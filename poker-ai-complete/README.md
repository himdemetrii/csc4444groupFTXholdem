- Handles all-in scenarios correctly

### ✅ Card Format Conversion
- Automatic server ↔ model format conversion
- Handles all suits and ranks
- Proper encoding for neural network

### ✅ Turn Detection
- Only acts when it's your turn
- Reliable toActIdx checking
- No premature actions

### ✅ Action Validation
- Ensures legal moves only
- Smart CHECK ↔ CALL conversion

## 📊 Model Architecture Comparison

### Basic Model
```python
Input:
  - hole_cards: [batch, 2, 2]
  - board_cards: [batch, 5, 2]

Output:
  - logits: [batch, 7]  # 7 actions
  - value: [batch, 1]   # Expected return
```

### Enhanced Model ⭐
```python
Input:
  - hole_cards: [batch, 2, 2]
  - board_cards: [batch, 5, 2]
  - context: [batch, 7]     # NEW! Game state features

Output:
  - logits: [batch, 7]
  - value: [batch, 1]
```

**Context features:**
1. My chips (normalized)
2. Pot size (normalized)
3. Phase (WAITING/PREFLOP/FLOP/TURN/RIVER/SHOWDOWN)
4. Position (seat index)
5. Number of players
6. Stack-to-pot ratio (SPR)
7. Hand number (game progression)

## 🎮 How To Use

### Option A: Quick Test (Basic Model)
```bash
python tests/integration_test.py  # Verify setup
python src/poker_client.py        # Play (suboptimal)
```

### Option B: Smart Play (Enhanced Model) ⭐
```bash
python tests/integration_test.py          # Verify setup
python src/poker_client_enhanced.py       # Play (smart!)
```

### Option C: Full Retraining (Best)
```bash
# 1. Modify your training code to use EnhancedPokerNet
# 2. Add context features to training data
# 3. Retrain model
# 4. Save weights: torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
# 5. Use enhanced client with trained model
python src/poker_client_enhanced.py
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit the bottom of `poker_client.py` or `poker_client_enhanced.py`:

```python
API_KEY = "dev"           # Must match server's API_KEY
TABLE_ID = "table-1"      # Must be registered on server
PLAYER_ID = "bot1"        # Unique identifier
SERVER_HOST = "localhost"
SERVER_PORT = "8080"
MODEL_PATH = None         # Or "model.pth" for trained weights
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
python tests/integration_test.py
```

**Tests included:**
1. ✅ Card parsing (server → model format)
2. ✅ Card extraction from game state
3. ✅ Hand strength calculation
4. ✅ Model inference
5. ✅ Action mapping (model → server format)
6. ✅ Turn detection
7. ✅ Full decision pipeline

**Expected:** 7/7 tests pass

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"
→ Start the Go server first: `go run cmd/main.go`

### "Unauthorized"
→ Check `API_KEY` matches server's environment variable

### "Unknown table"
→ Verify `TABLE_ID` is registered on server

### "Not your turn"
→ Check turn detection logic, verify `toActIdx`

### Bot doesn't act
→ Run `integration_test.py` to verify setup
→ Check server logs for errors
→ Ensure player ID matches

### Tests fail
→ Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
→ Verify Python 3.8+
→ Check error messages

## 🎯 Key Differences: Basic vs Enhanced

| Feature | Basic | Enhanced |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Sees cards | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sees chip count | ❌ | ✅ |
| Sees pot size | ❌ | ✅ |
| Sees phase | ❌ | ✅ |
| Sees position | ❌ | ✅ |
| Calculates SPR | ❌ | ✅ |
| Context-aware | ❌ | ✅ |
| Strategic decisions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Good for winning | ❌ | ✅ |

**Verdict**: Use enhanced version! ⭐

---

## 💡 Important Notes

### Betting Amounts
- All bets are **whole integers** (as expected by server)
- Three raise sizes: Small (2x BB), Medium (3.5x BB), Large (5x BB)
- Suitable for most play; can be extended if needed

### Server Validation
- Server strictly validates CHECK vs CALL
- Client automatically converts illegal actions
- All-in scenarios handled correctly

### Known Limitation
- Server doesn't send `toCall` amount in state
- Client uses heuristics as workaround
- Works well in practice; ask server team to add `toCall` for 100% accuracy

## 🚦 Next Steps

### Immediate (Get Playing)
1. ✅ Install dependencies
2. ✅ Run integration tests
3. ✅ Start Go server
4. ✅ Run enhanced client

### Short-term (Improve Performance)
1. Retrain with context features
2. Tune raise sizes and strategy
3. Add hand history tracking
4. Test against multiple opponents

### Long-term (Advanced Features)
1. Opponent modeling
2. Online learning from results
3. Multi-table support
4. Tournament mode
5. Bankroll management

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

**Basic Model:**
- Makes reasonable decisions with good cards
- Blind to game context
- Suboptimal strategy

**Enhanced Model:**
- Context-aware decisions
- Adjusts for stack size, pot odds, position
- Much better strategic play
- Will improve significantly with retraining
